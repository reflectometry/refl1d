The Refl1D package was originally developed under DANSE project (2006-2011),
with a transition to a period of community support in 2011 
(primarily maintained at NIST)

In 2024, a new collaboration was formed with developers from

- the National Institute of Standards and Technology (Gaithersburg, MD, USA)
- ISIS Neutron and Muon Source (Oxfordshire, UK)
- Oak Ridge National Laboratory (Oak Ridge, TN, USA)

dedicated to the continued development of the package, and delivery of new
features and capabilities to the user community.

We are grateful for the existence of many fine open source packages such
as `Pyparsing <http://pyparsing.wikispaces.com/>`_,
`NumPy <http://numpy.scipy.org/>`_ and `Python <http://www.python.org/>`_
without which this package would be much more difficult to write.
