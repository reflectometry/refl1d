Soft matter systems have more complex interfaces than slab layers with
gaussian roughness.

We will now model a data set for tethered deuterated polystyrene chains.
The chains start out at approximately 10 nm thick in dry conditions, and
swell to 14-18 nm thickness in toluene.  Two measurements were made:

 * :download:`10ndt001.refl <10ndt001.refl>` in deuterated toluene

 * :download:`10nht001.refl <10nht001.refl>`  in hydrogenated toluene

The chains are bound to the substrate by an initiator layer between the
substrate and brush chains. So the model needs a silicon layer, silicon
oxide layer, an initiator layer which is mostly hydrocarbon and
scattering length density should be between 0 and 1.5 depending on how
much solvent is in the layer. Then you have the swollen brush chains and
at the end bulk solvent. For these swelling measurements, the beam
penetrate the system from the silicon side and the bottom layer is
deuterated or hydrogenated toluene.
