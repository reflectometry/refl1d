These tutorials describe the process of defining reflectometry depth
profiles using scripts.  Scripts are defined using
`Python <http://www.python.org>`_.  Python is easy enough that you should
be able to follow the tutorial and use one of our examples as a starting
point for your own models.  A complete introduction to programming
and Python is beyond the scope of this document, and the reader is referred
to the many fine tutorials that exist on the web.
