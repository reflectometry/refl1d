"""
This script uses py2exe to create dist\refl1d.exe and dist\refl1d_gui.exe for
running the Refl1D application in either CLI or GUI mode.

These executables start the application and import the rest of the application
code stored in library.zip.  The python interpreter and other required python
packages and dlls are also placed in the zip file.  Additional resource files
that are needed when Refl1D is run are copied to the dist directory tree.  On
completion, the contents of the dist directory tree can be used by the Inno
Setup Compiler (via a separate script) to build a Windows installer/uninstaller
for deployment of the Refl1D application.  For testing purposes, refl1d.exe or
refl1d_gui.exe can be run from the dist directory.
