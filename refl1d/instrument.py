Reflectometry instrument definitions.

An instrument definition contains all the information necessary to compute
the resolution for a measurement.  See :mod:`resolution` for details.

This module is intended to help define new instrument loaders

Scanning Reflectometers
=======================

:mod:`refl1d.instrument` (this module) defines two instrument types:
:class:`Monochromatic` and :class:`Pulsed`. These represent
generic scanning and time of flight instruments, respectively.

To perform a simulation or load a data set, a measurement geometry must
be defined.  In the following example, we set up the geometry for a
pretend instrument SP:2. The complete geometry needs to include information
to calculate wavelength resolution (wavelength and wavelength dispersion)
as well as angular resolution (slit distances and openings, and perhaps
sample size and sample warp).  In this case, we are using a scanning
monochromatic instrument with slits of 0.1 mm below 0.5\ |deg| and
opening slits  above 0.5\ |deg| starting at 0.2 mm.  The monochromatic
instrument assumes a fixed $\Delta \theta / \theta$ while opening.

    >>> from refl1d.names import *
    >>> geometry = Monochromatic(instrument="SP:2", radiation="neutron",
    ...    wavelength=5.0042, dLoL=0.009, d_s1=230+1856, d_s2=230,
    ...    Tlo=0.5, slits_at_Tlo=0.2, slits_below=0.1)

This instrument can be used to  a data file, or generate a
measurement probe for use in modeling or to read in a previously
measured data set or generate a probe for simulation:

    >>> from numpy import linspace, loadtxt
    >>> datafile = sample_data('10ndt001.refl')
    >>> Q, R, dR = loadtxt(datafile).T
    >>> probe = geometry.probe(Q=Q, data=(R, dR))
    >>> simulation = geometry.probe(T=linspace(0, 5, 51))

All instrument parameters can be specified when constructing the probe,
replacing the defaults that are associated with the instrument.  For
example, to include sample broadening effects in the resolution:

    >>> probe2 = geometry.probe(Q=Q, data=(R, dR), sample_broadening=0.1,
    ...    name="probe2")

For magnetic systems a polarized beam probe is needed::

    >>> magnetic_probe = geometry.magnetic_probe(T=numpy.linspace(0, 5, 100))

The string representation of the geometry prints a multi-line
description of the default instrument configuration:

    >>> print(geometry)
    == Instrument SP:2 ==
    radiation = neutron at 5.0042 Angstrom with 0.9% resolution
    slit distances = 2086 mm and 230 mm
    fixed region below 0.5 and above 90 degrees
    slit openings at Tlo are 0.2 mm
    sample width = 1e+10 mm
    sample broadening = 0 degrees

Predefined Instruments
======================

Specific instruments can be defined for each facility.  This saves the users
having to remember details of the instrument geometry.

For example, the above SP:2 instrument could be defined as follows:

    >>> class SP2(Monochromatic):
    ...    instrument = "SP:2"
    ...    radiation = "neutron"
    ...    wavelength = 5.0042   # Angstroms
    ...    dLoL = 0.009          # FWHM
    ...    d_s1 = 230.0 + 1856.0 # mm
    ...    d_s2 = 230.0          # mm
    ...    def load(self, filename, **kw):
    ...        Q, R, dR = loadtxt(datafile).T
    ...        probe = self.probe(Q=Q, data=(R, dR), **kw)
    ...        return probe

This definition can then be used to define the measurement geometry.  We
have added a load method which knows about the facility file format (in
this case, three column ASCII data Q, R, dR) so that we can load a datafile
in a couple of lines of code:

    >>> geometry = SP2(Tlo=0.5, slits_at_Tlo=0.2, slits_below=0.1)
    >>> probe3 = geometry.load(datafile)

The defaults() method prints the static components of the geometry:

    >>> print(SP2.defaults())
    == Instrument class SP:2 ==
    radiation = neutron at 5.0042 Angstrom with 0.9% resolution
    slit distances = 2086 mm and 230 mm

GUI Usage
=========

Graphical user interfaces follow different usage patterns from scripts.
Here the emphasis will be on selecting a data set to process, displaying
its default metadata and allowing the user to override it.

File loading should follow the pattern established in reflectometry
reduction, with an extension registry and a fallback scheme whereby
files can be checked in a predefined order.  If the file cannot be
loaded, then the next loader is tried.  This should be extended with
the concept of a magic signature such as those used by graphics and
sound file applications: read the first block and run it through
the signature check before trying to load it.  For unrecognized
extensions, all loaders can be tried.

The file loader should return an instrument instance with metadata
initialized from the file header.  This metadata can be displayed
to the user along with a plot of the data and the resolution.  When
metadata values are changed, the resolution can be recomputed and the
display updated.  When the data set is accepted, the final resolution
calculation can be performed.
